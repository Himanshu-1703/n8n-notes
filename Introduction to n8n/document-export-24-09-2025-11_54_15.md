### What are Workflows
Series of steps --> arranged sequentially --> arrangement in a logical order.

Based on the goal --> We decide the order of arrangement.



A --> B --> C --> END

As a list of steps:

1. A
2. B
3. C

We Define the workflows as **Graphs:**

1. nodes: Steps/Tasks/Actions
2. edges: Connections.
